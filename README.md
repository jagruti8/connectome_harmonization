# Structural Connectome Harmonization Using Deep Learning

This repository contains the code for the paper  
**"Structural Connectome Harmonization Using Deep Learning: The Strength of Graph Neural Networks."**

The project focuses on harmonizing structural connectivity matrices acquired using different diffusion imaging parameters.

## Directory Structure

Inside the `batch_scripts` directory, there are two subfolders:

- `parameters/`: Contains text files for setting argument parameter options.
- `scripts/`: Contains script files for submitting jobs to a high-performance computing (HPC) environment.
